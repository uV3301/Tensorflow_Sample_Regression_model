# Tensorflow_Sample_Regression_model
A tensorflow model built using keras and python libraries to predict data.

### A simple Deep network architectured to make predictions as follows<br>
Given a dataset 'Car purchasing data' which holds data of people with their key financial variables/values.<br>
The goal is to find out the Car Purchasing Power/Amount of the individual.<br>
The model is made possible using Keras ( A python writen neural network library ).<br>
Also libraries like pandas, seaborn, sklearn, etc are used for data manipulation, visualizations, preprocessing etc.<br>

### Some visualizations from the dataset
